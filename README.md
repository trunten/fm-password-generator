# Password Generator

## Description

I was given the task of writing JavaScript code to produce an application that generates a random password using paramaters/options provided by the user

Application functionality requirements:
- Generate a password when the button is clicked
  - Present a form for password criteria
    - Length of password
      - At least 10 characters but no more than 64
    - Character types
      - Lowercase
      - Uppercase
      - Numeric
      - Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
  - Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
  - If input passes validation then the password should be generated and written to the page

The application will be completed when all of the above criteria are met and a random password is written to the page.
